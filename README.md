# Discord Bot

I started writing this bot in my first semester studying CS at ETH Zurich. I've since kept it updated and added new features. It is, however, tailor-made for our student discord server, and will likely not run as intended on other servers.

### Following features have been added so far:
* Karma
  * Can track up- and downvotes of each post
  * Keeps track of user's karma balance, in categories "post" and "link" (Post is pure text, link everything else)
  * Can display leaderboards for highest karma holder and highest upvoted post (all time, last month and last week)
* Karma Kasino
  * Admins can create bets
  * Users can bet karma on said bets
  * Admins can lock bets, to prevent users from continuing to bet
  * Admins can conclude bets, which distributes karma to the winner
* Image Manipulation
  * Can create eerily realistic Trump tweet screenshots given a text
  * Can create Impact font memes when given a base image (JPG or PNG), top and bottom text
* Reddit *(Currently disabled)*
  * Can display a random reddit post from a given subreddit
  * Can display a random reddit image post from a given subreddit
  * Admins can ban subreddits for use on the server
  * Users can display a list of all banned subreddits
